### tensorflow_in_practice_specialization

My summary and personal notes on the Coursera's course on tensorflow "[Tensorflow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/home/welcome)", the latest part of deeplearning.ai specialization.  

The repository includes:
- My personal summary and notes.
- Codes that has been discussed during the video lectures.
- For more practice the later part has completed and changed based on my personal taste for commenting and digging into other related practices  and aspects of the discussed topic.
- Also, my implementation of the exercies are presented in this repo. I have changed the codes based on the needs and for more practice. 
- The reporsitory also includes the expanded/reimplemented codes and exercises using the lower level api of Tensorflow 1.x for some of the practices.
