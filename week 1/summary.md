## Week one summary

- Difference between traditional programming vs. machine learning/deep learning:
  - traditional programming: input: rules, data -> output: answers  [you need to know the pattern and functionality beforehand.]
  - machine learning: input:answers (labels), data -> output: rules [learning an unknown patterns and functionality]
  
- Dense: a layer of unconnected neurons, which will be connected to the next layer nodes [course wrongly mentioned a layer of connected node!]

- Loss function: function to be use to measure how good is the prediction.
- Optimizer: Will generate a new and improved guess based on the current guess and prediction
- Convergence: Is the process of getting closer to the correct predictive function
- Fitting: is the process of training, which tries to fit the set of inputs to targets.
